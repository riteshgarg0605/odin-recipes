        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Position oven racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 375°F. Line 2 large rimmed baking
                sheets with
                parchment paper.</li>
            <li> Whisk all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, granulated sugar, baking powder and salt together in a
                large bowl until
                combined. Add butter and beat with an electric mixer on low speed until the butter is completely blended
                into the flour
                mixture, about 1 minute. Add milk, egg, lemon zest and vanilla; continue beating on low speed until
                blended, about 1
                minute, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Chill the dough, uncovered, for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Using lightly floured hands, roll the dough into 24 (1-inch) balls and place 1 inch apart on the
                prepared baking sheets.
                Bake on the upper and lower oven racks until the edges are light golden and the tops are dry to the
                touch, 10 to 12
                minutes. Cool on the pans for 5 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely, about 30
                minutes. (Reserve
                the baking sheets with parchment paper for glazing.)</li>
            <li> Whisk confectioners' sugar and lemon juice together in a small bowl until smooth. Place the cooled
                cookies, still on the
                wire racks, over the parchment paper-lined baking sheets. Drizzle the glaze (about 2 teaspoons per
                cookie) over the tops
                of the cookies.</li>
        </ol>
